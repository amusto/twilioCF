Contact Messaging System (Coldfusion and Twilio SMS)

This system was build to provide a way for building security to import a list of tenants and their cell numbers so that when someone reported a security issue via their cell phone we could track the personwho sent a text in the case we need more information. 

Front and back end code is all Coldfusion driven, Twilio  
I created a full stack application that allowed an admin to import and manage lists of tenants in an apartment complex 
Their details, apartment numbers and cell phones were recorded and the complex was provided a single 1-800 number with which they could text and report security concerns.  
This was a major tool for law enforcement helping to track and follow up with credible leads. The main goal here was to help resolve crime concerns and ultimately improve the property value of the apartment complex.
Front and backend provided a secured and eloquent UX for the user experience. The API and backend communication application was setup to retrieve and provide all incoming sms messages providing advanced filtering and reporting on various incoming data.
