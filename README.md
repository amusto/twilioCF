Contact Messaging System (Coldfusion and Twilio SMS)

This system was build to provide a way for building security to import a list of tenants and their cell numbers so that when someone reported a security issue via their cell phone we could track the personwho sent a text in the case we need more information. 

Front and back end code is all Coldfusion driven,
